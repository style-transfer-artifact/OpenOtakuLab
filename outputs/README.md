# OtakuLab Outputs

This directory contains the experimental results and model artifacts for the paper.

## 📂 Included in Repository
The following lightweight results are directly included in this repository for reproducibility:

*   **`pmi/`**: Extracted style keywords (JSON).
*   **`pragmatic/`**: Pragmatic style analysis results (JSONL).
*   **`rag/`**: FAISS indexes and corpuses for RAG evaluation.
*   **`meta_learner/`**: Lightweight meta-learner models (PyTorch `.pth`).
*   **`cons/`**: Constituency parse trees (JSON) for most styles (except PsyDC).

## ☁️ Hosted on External Platforms
Due to file size limits, large models and datasets are hosted on **Hugging Face**: [style-transfer-artifact/OtakuLab · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/style-transfer-artifact/OtakuLab).
